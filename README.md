I'm a pretty big reader. What I tend to struggle with is finding new books I like. Genres have more overlap and complexity than people assume. A book can be both a romance novel as well as a thriller. The question I aim to answer is what books are similar reads based on their genres? The stakeholders in this case are avid readers looking for their next read. This will help readers find new books to enjoy and explore more genres. In this post, I'll walk you through how I used cosine similarity to rank books based on genre similarity, giving readers a more personalized way to explore literature.
